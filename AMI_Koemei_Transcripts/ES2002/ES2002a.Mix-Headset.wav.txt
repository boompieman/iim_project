SPK02

Uh_huh select a she has produced a powerpoint Uh I think it's already on actually 

SPK02

we'll try the main thing work yeah applies in the back but okay right. Now I yes okay right well was the kickoff meeting for our our project and this is just what we're gonna be doing in the next twenty five minutes. Um so personal just to kind of make sure that we all know each other I'm your and I'm the project manager don't introduce yourself again 

SPK00

Um data and I'm supposed to be industrial designer okay 

SPK05

Andrew and I'm the marketing an expert. I'm pregnant agent 

SPK02

great okay I was we're designing any remote control. And oh I have to record he's here actually so this do the Andrew and created and you'll arrived on time. Um yes it is a design a new remote control as you can see is this be original trendy and user friendly. Um so that's kind of our our brief the wire and so there are three different stages to the design. And I'm not sure what what you guys have already received in your emails what'd you get I just 

SPK00

got the project announcement "'cause" I know you 

SPK05

had to calls okay so we're gonna have like individual work and then a meeting about it. And repeat that process three times. Um and at this point we get try out the whiteboard over there. I so you get to draw your favourite animal and sum up your favourite characteristics of that so you'd like to get more is very kids I 

SPK00

alright. So this one here right 

SPK02

okay I don't 

SPK00

alright my favourite animal and like ah a L I characters very characteristics are about 

SPK02

right yeah 

SPK00

alright well basically high priority for any animal for me is that they be willing to take a lot of physical affection from the family. And just yeah they have lots of personality and this this and then robust good health. So this is the bigger I families be 

SPK02

right lovely yeah 

SPK00

no matter of on would be a monkey 

SPK02

I I the 

SPK00

smoke even for a and then one for the gonna real no and when the other with them 

SPK02

right here you can take as long over this is a like because we haven't got an awful lot there's of day today don't feel like your interaction anyway 

SPK00

actually told me a lot more about the eagles it's 

SPK02

so much or what have to get yeah because I don't know mine isn't gonna think on the spot 

SPK00

impressionist oh 

SPK02

is that a whale yeah yeah I 

SPK00

well like I don't know it's just for am I can think of the top of my head figure is in this "'cause" I'm allergic to most animals animal for so fish was a natural choice it was becoming ill 

SPK05

I mean so I for a mess 

SPK00

and mild an interesting 

SPK05

okay I still didn't interaction with 

SPK00

superb sketch by the way yeah okay I was 

SPK02

gonna choose a dog as well. But I just a different kind of dogs are my favourite animal is my dog at home I that doesn't really look like actually looks more like a pig actually oh right. see 

SPK00

a dog in there yeah yeah that's a good idea no serious too 

SPK02

I what kind of "'em" he's a mixture of of various things. Um and what I like about it. Um that's just as the death that his tail why. And very friendly and teary and always pleased to see you and very kind of affectionate and and it's quite quite we as well so you know you can doesn't take up too much space. Um the thing does a funny thing reaches detail. That's quite amusing yeah where this his own genitalia 

SPK00

thing 

SPK02

I think anything and it has actually had is dinner I and it just all of a sudden is get up and start chasing his tail pipe it around the living room yeah 

SPK00

only when use little he got lots of attention for doing it and I conditioned 

SPK02

maybe yeah that where did you find this just down here okay Reading next. Um okay mean I need to discuss the project fine now so according to the brief we're gonna be selling this remote control for twenty five euro. Um and we're aiming to make fifty million euro. Um so we're gonna be selling this on an international scale. And we do want to cost anymore than twelve fifty euros so fifty percent to the selling price 

SPK00

and we just go over that again sure so this alright okay so cost like production cost is altogether a fifty but selling price is is that wholesale or retail like on the shelf 

SPK02

I dunno I imagine. That's gross two hours I marginal probably is are still actually because it's probably up to the the retailer to myself whatever price they want but I I don't know I mean do you think the fact that it's going to be sold internationally will have a bearing on how we design it at all yeah I think it will 

SPK00

all right away I'm wondering if there is like the DVD players if they are zones 

SPK02

oh yeah regions stuff is limited or something yeah 

SPK00

okay as well as characters different keypad styles and some yeah 

SPK02

well for a remote control do you think that would be a specific depends on how complicated a remote control is 

SPK00

except "'cause" you have Marco okay languages buttons yeah 

SPK05

yeah yeah okay 

SPK00

and then and then all the other thing international is on top of the price I'm thinking the price might might appeal to a certain market in one region whereas in another it'll be different so 

SPK02

but just I returned just like the rest of the country like how much money people have to spend on or 

SPK00

just like basic product today positioning twenty five euro remote control might be a big hit in London might not be such a big hit in grease you know and 

SPK02

it yeah yeah marketing get marketing thoughts Google I should be writing all this time. Um 

SPK00

right away I'm making some kind of assumptions about what what information we're given here thinking. K trendy probably means something other than just basic yeah something other than just standard. Um so I'm wondering right away selling twenty five years is that sort of that but is it's gonna be like the premium product 

SPK02

yeah yeah like how much does you know remote control cost well twenty five euro I mean that that's what like eighteen pounds or something isn't gonna is it as much as a sixteen seventeen eighteen point doctors. Um as you know I've never for remote control so you know how how good a remote control that would get you I but yes is it has to look kind of cool gimmicky. Um right okay you just go on ahead here. Okay well it does anybody have anything to add to to the finance issue at all 

SPK00

do we have any other background information on like how that compares to others 

SPK02

no actually that would be useful though wouldn't if you knew like what your money would get you know 

SPK00

he interesting thing about discussing production a remote control for me is that as you point out I still think remote controls being summoned something people consciously assess in their purchasing habits yeah just like getting shoelaces issues or something just I 

SPK02

right. And the meeting oh okay we're behind yeah 

SPK00

I mean like yeah exactly how do you I I mean one one way look at or be well the people producing television sets maybe they have to buy a remote control or another way is maybe people have TV sets every fed up with their remote control. And they really want another one or something. I think a number by remote controls because the guy that up of having four or five different clothes which right eyes right okay was just many devices control right so in function one of the priorities might be to combine as many uses 

SPK02

right. So you do think that should be like a main designing of a remote control them you know but to do your your satellite and your regular tele your VCR and everything well like 

SPK00

maybe what we could use as a sort of like a example of a successful other piece technologies palm palm pilots. They're gone from being just like little sort of scribble boards to cameras MP three player telephones everything agenda. So like I wonder if we might add something new to the to the remote control and it such as the lighting in your house or or 

SPK02

even gonna in you its abides what you wanna watch like you might put in there alone how such intense a car that's a good idea and so extra functionality 

SPK00

yeah like personally for me at home I've I've combined the the audio video might television set and my DVD player my CD player. So they will work actually function together but I differ remote controls feature that it's sort of ironic that that then they're in there you know the sound everything is just one system but each one's gonna own little part 

SPK02

okay I'd all are gonna have to wrap up pretty quickly nice couple of minutes I'll just check if nothing else. Okay so anything else anybody wants at about what they don't like about remote controls think he's what they would really like to be part of this new one all you think you keep losing them okay same yeah 

SPK00

yeah really small or when you want them 

SPK05

yeah yeah you get this one's weaknesses if you like Whistler make really high pitched noise they'd be yeah there I mean is that something we don't include you think tonight sure okay maybe I remember when 

SPK00

the first remote control my my family had was on a cable actually the cable between TV and big like buttons it sort of like like on a plant or something again and you know and I think about what they are now is better but actually it's still kind of I don't know like a massive junkie thing on the table stable we can think about how could be more you know streamline 

SPK02

maybe like touch screen or something something like yeah 

SPK00

whatever B technologically reasonable 

SPK02

okay well introductory industrial designer it could be the 

SPK00

functionally that doesn't make it any better but that just the appeals passion of not having you know these days is every piercings in people's homes are becoming more and more like sheik you know yeah nicer materials and okay might be okay do worth exploring 

SPK02

right well so just to wrap up the next meeting's gonna be in thirty minutes so that's about about ten to twelve by my watch so in between now and then as the industrial designer you're gonna be working on you know that's a working design of that so you know you're doing their for user interface technical functions I guess that's you know like what we've been talking about what it'll actually day. And and marketing executive you'll be just thinking about what it actually what you know what requirements that has to has to fulfil. And you'll get instructions email TI guess okay okay yes S at the functional design stages next I guess and and that's the end of the meeting. So I got a little message a lot sooner than I thought I would say 

SPK00

before we wrap up just to make sure on the same page do we we were given sort of an example of a coffee machine right well are we may right now on the assumption that are television remote control may have features which go beyond the television or are we keeping sort of like a design commitment to television features 

SPK02

okay well just very quickly "'cause" we're supposed to finish no I I guess that's not to us I mean you probably want some kind of unique selling point of it's okay so you know me okay yeah okay depends on much you think yeah I mean okay right okay well that's that's the end of the meeting then I thank you all for coming I I gonna hit that was what they want us to right great how you tennis thing it function and oh okay I think if you can just leave it on maybe and then oh god this time some people 

SPK00

function oh 

SPK05

that is I think it was okay right oh okay okay yeah yeah
