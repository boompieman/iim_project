        <title>The non-spanning comparison display</title>
          
        <para>This is the first in a series of tools to display
        multiple versions of a particular type of annotation. The
        <emphasis>non-spanning comparison display</emphasis> can show
        two different annotators' data over the same base-level
        transcription. We use <emphasis>annotator</emphasis> loosely
        to mean any human or machine process that results in an
        annotation. This is a display only, not an annotation
        tool. Display details are controlled using a configuration
        file much like the other end user GUIs, though there are two
        extra settings required (see below)<remark>Where?</remark>. The display shows the two
        annotators' names, with the first underlined and the second
        italicised, in a small <guilabel>Annotator Legend</guilabel>
        window. Every annotation by the first annotator is underlined
        and every annotation by the second is italizized so that the
        two can be distinguished. The types of annotations will be
        distinguished in the same way as for the discourse entity
        coder.</para>
