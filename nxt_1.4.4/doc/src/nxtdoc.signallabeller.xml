        <title>The signal labeller</title>

        <para>The signal labeller is for creating timestamped labels against
        signal, with the labels chosen from an enumerated list. This can be
        used for a very wide range of low-level annotations, such as gaze
        direction, movement in the room, rough starts and ends of turns, and
        areas to be included in or excluded from some other analysis. The tool
        treats the labels as mutually exclusive and exhaustive states; as the
        user plays the signal, whenever a new label is chosen (either with the
        mouse or using keyboard shortcuts), that time is used both for the
        beginning of the new label and the end of the old one. Although there
        are several similar tools available, this tool will work on either
        audio or video signals, including playing a set of synchronized
        signals together, and works natively on NXT format data, which is of
        benefit for user groups that intend to use NXT for further annotation.
        It does not, however, currently include either the palette-based
        displays popular from <application>Anvil</application> and <application>TASX</application>, and the signal control is meant
        for the coarser style of real-time coding, not for the precision
        timing that some projects require. It also does not contain waveform
        display, and therefore is unsuitable for many kinds of speech
        annotation. </para>
