   <title>The discourse segmenter</title>

   <para>

        The final GUI is for segmenting discourse into contiguous
        stretches of text (or of speech by one person) and categorizing the
        segments. The most common use for this style of interface is a
        dialogue act coder. Coding is performed by marking the end of each
        discourse segment; the segment is assume to start at the end of the
        last segment (or the last segment by the same speaker, with the option
        of not allowing segments to draw words across some higher level
        boundary, such as previously marked speaker turns). A permanent
        dialogue box displays information about the currently selected act and
        allows a number of properties to be specified for it beyond simple
        type. The coding mechanisms supported include a tickbox to cover
        boolean properties such as termination of the act before completion,
        free text comments, and choice from a small, enumerated, mutuallly
        exclusive list, such as might be used for noting the dialogue act's
        addressee. Although this structure covers some styles of dialogue act
        coding, this tool is not suitable for schemes such as MRDA where
        dual-coding from the same act type list is allowed. This tool
        additionally allows the user to indicate directional relationships
        between acts using the same mechanism as in the discourse entity
        coder, although for current dialogue act schemes this is a minority
        requirement.
