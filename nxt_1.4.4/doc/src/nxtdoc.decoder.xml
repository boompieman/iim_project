        <title>The discourse entity coder</title>

        <para>The second end user GUI is for coding discourse entities above
        an existing text or speech transcription. Coding is performed by
        sweeping out the words in the entity and then mousing on the correct
        entity type from a static display of the named entity type ontology,
        or choosing it by keyboard shortcut. It can be used for any coding
        that requires the user to categorize contiguous stretches of text (or
        of speech by one person) using labels chosen from a tree-shaped
        ontology. In addition, it allows the user to indicate directional
        relationships between two coded entities, with the relationship
        categorized from a set of labels. The most common uses for this style
        of interface are in marking up named entities and coreferential
        relationships.</para>
