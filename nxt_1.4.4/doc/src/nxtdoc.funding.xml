    <title>NXT's history and funding</title>

    <para>The NITE XML Toolkit is software that arose out of a
    European Commission-funded collaboration between the University of
    Edinburgh's <ulink url="http://www.ltg.ed.ac.uk">The Language
    Technology Group</ulink>, the University of Stuttgart's <ulink
    url="http://www.ims.uni-stuttgart.de">Institut f&#x00f6;r Maschinelle
    Sprachverarbeitung (IMS)</ulink>, and the <ulink
    url="http://www.dfki.de">Deutsches Forschungszentrum f&#x00f6;r
    K&#x00f6;nstliche Intelligenz (DFKI)</ulink>. Although the NITE project
    itself finished in 2003, the software is now being maintained and
    further developed via <ulink
    url="http://sourceforge.net/projects/nite/">Sourceforge</ulink>;
    the <ulink url="http://hmi.ewi.utwente.nl">University of Twente
    </ulink>has been a particularly active contributor. NXT is in use
    on a number of large distributed projects including <ulink
    url="http://www.jast-net.gr/">JAST</ulink>and <ulink
    url="http://www.talk-project.org/">TALK</ulink>. NXT is in use on
    a wide range of corpora, representing everything from Biblical
    text structure to the relationship between deictic expressions and
    gestures in multimodal referring expressions. Its users range from
    individual PhD students up to large multi-site projects, many of
    whom contribute to development in some way. The <ulink
    url="http://www.amiproject.org">AMI</ulink> consortium is its
    biggest user and also the largest current contributor to its
    development.  Other past and current funders
    are <ulink url="http://www.epsrc.ac.uk/">The Engineering and
    Physical Sciences Research Council (UK)</ulink> , <ulink
    url="http://www.esrc.ac.uk">The Economic and Social Research
    Council (UK)</ulink>, and<ulink
    url="http://www.scottish-enterprise.com/"> Scottish
    Enterprise</ulink>, via <ulink
