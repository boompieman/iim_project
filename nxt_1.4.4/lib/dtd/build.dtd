      annotators' files are explicitly requested, move these to the
      traditional 'gold-standard location. If there are no
      gold-standard files, and a specific coder has not been
      requested, no files are included. 'multi-coder' means include
      'gold-standard' and all annotator directories unless a
      particular annotator's files are requested, which means we don't
      include the other annotators' files. No annotator-specific files
      are moved to be gold-standard here.
