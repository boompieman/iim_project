How to schema-validate a NOM corpus:
-----------------------------------
19/2/03 Jonathan Kilgour.

First run the utility program
 java PrepareSchemaValidation -c <corpus-metadata-file> -o <outdir>

This program should be present in your NITE distribution.

The output directory will now contain what you need for
schema-validating your corpus. First choose your schema validator (we
use xsv in these examples) and try it on one of your files, for example:
 xsv o1.words.xml
Check for errors. Please note that if the instance has not been
assessed and there are schema errors, something has gone wrong with
the preparation. Please send jonathan@cogsci.ed.ac.uk your metadata
file!

If your corpus is valid, you will find that not only will all the XML
files in your corpus validate, but that the "knit" versions also
validate. Knitting involves inserting referenced children and pointers
as real child nodes in your corpus, so that you can check that those
are valid. Try:
 java org.apache.xalan.xslt.Process -in o1.words.xml -xsl knit.xsl -out words1.xml
and then: xsv words1.xml
This will check for invalid children and pointers in the file
"o1.words.xml".
