<h1>Getting started</h1>

<p>The Continuous Video Labeling Tool is started from the main program of the
NITE XML Toolkit. After selecting Continuous Video Labeling, you can select an
observation. In this tutorial we use the observation <b>m4-1</b>. When the tool
is started, the screen will only show a video player. Before you can make
annotations, you have to select at least one agent and one layer from the
<b>Annotate</b> menu.</p>

<p><img src="../images/cvl-annotate-small.png" width="510" height="365"></p>
<p>Figure 1: Selecting agents and layers for annotation</p>

<p>The menu in Figure 1 shows four agents named <b>p0</b>, <b>p1</b>,
<b>p2</b> and <b>p3</b>. The available layers are <b>sp-layer</b> (for speaking
and non-speaking), <b>gaze-layer</b>, <b>posture-layer</b> and
<b>gesture-layer</b>. Figure 2 shows the screen after agent <b>p3</b> and the
posture layer have been selected.</p>

<p><img src="../images/cvl-p3-posture-small.png" width="510" height="365"></p>
<p>Figure 2: Posture annotation for agent p3</p>

<p>Your screen shows annotation windows for all combinations of the selected
agents and layers. In this case there is one window for posture annotation for
agent p3. An annotation window consists of three parts. The top part is the
annotation area, which contains the annotations that were made. It is still
empty here. Under the annotation area you can see the current annotation and
a <b>Delete</b> button, which will delete the selected annotation. At the
bottom are the target buttons. There is one button for each possible target.
In this case there are four buttons named <b>Lean Backward</b>, <b>Lean
Right</b>, <b>Lean Left</b> and <b>Lean Forward</b>. Those are the targets of
the posture layer.</p>

<p>Figure 3: Posture and gaze annotation for agent p3</p>

<p>Now we will select the gaze layer as well from the <b>Annotate</b> menu.
Another annotation window appears, but this time the effect is different, as
shown in Figure 3. The targets of the gaze layer are agents. Because of that,
the buttons are arranged so that they match the positions of the speakers in
the video, and an extra set of buttons is created and arranged around the video
player. In signal <b>cam1</b>, which is currently selected in the video player,
the camera faces persons 3 and 1. At the other side of the table, but not
visible in the video, are persons 2 and 0. From the positions of the buttons it
should be clear where the agents are seated. When you select another signal at
the top of the video player, the buttons will be rearranged.</p>

<p>It is assumed that an agent cannot be the target of his own annotation. In
the case of gaze, the agent cannot gaze at himself. That is why in this screen
there is no button for person 3. At his position there is a button named <b>No
target</b>.</p>

<p>Now we are ready to make some annotations. We don't want to annotate posture
for now, so deselect the posture layer from the <b>Annotate</b> menu. Then
we start the video. While the video is played back, you can click the target
buttons to make annotations. Sometimes it is easier to make annotations by
pausing the video at certain points. With the slider at the bottom of the video
player, you can also slow down or fasten up playback. We are making annotations
for person 3, which is the person at the left in the current video signal. In
Figure 4, the video is paused while person 3 is gazing at person 2.</p>

<p><img src="../images/cvl-target-start1-small.png" width="510" height="365"></p>
<p>Figure 4: Person 3 gazes at person 2</p>

<p>At this point we click <b>Person 2</b>. In the annotation window you can see
that person 2 is the current target. The start time of this annotation has been
filled with the current time (2.77). The end time is still 0. The annotation is
not really made until the end time is filled. That is done as soon as you start
a new annotation. For instance Figure 5 shows a later point in the video. At
this point person 3 stopped gazing at person 2 and is now gazing at nobody.</p>

<p><img src="../images/cvl-target-start2-small.png" width="510" height="365"></p>
<p>Figure 5: Person 3 stopped gazing at person 2</p>

<p>Now you click <b>No target</b>. The previous annotation is completed. The
end time is filled with the current time. The annotation is added to the
annotation area at the top of the annotation window. The dots give an
indication of the duration. The annotation window also shows the new
annotation. The target is <b>No target</b>, the end time is still 0 and the
start time is the current time. Note that this is the same as the end time of
the previous annotation. The Continuous Video Labeling Tool ensures that the
annotations are always continuous, so the end time of one annotation is the
start time of the next annotation.</p>

<p>We continue a bit more, so our screen looks like the screen in Figure 6.</p>

<p><img src="../images/cvl-target-start3-small.png" width="510" height="365"></p>
<p>Figure 6: More gaze annotations for person 3</p>

<p>You can select annotations by clicking them in the annotation window. Note
that the annotation window must be activated first! Then you can choose to play
the video fragment for the selected annotation. This is done by holding the
CTRL key and clicking the right mouse button.</p>

<p>The annotations can be edited by deleting them or inserting new annotations
over them. We will now delete the <b>No target</b> annotation. Select it in the
annotation area and then click the <b>Delete</b> button. To keep the
annotations continuous, the previous annotation (the first <b>Person 1</b>)
will fill the empty space. Because now we have two <b>Person 1</b> annotations
after each other, they can be merged, so only one annotation is left. Your
screen should look like Figure 7.</p>

<p><img src="../images/cvl-target-delete-small.png" width="510" height="365"></p>
<p>Figure 7: Deleted the no target annotation</p>

<p>Now we will insert the <b>No target</b> annotation again. Reset the video to
the start by dragging the playback line marker. Then start the video. Note that
as the video is playing, the annotation for that part of the video is
highlighted. When person 3 stops gazing at person 2, click the <b>No target</b>
button (you may want to pause the video at that point). Continue playing until
person 3 gazes at person 2 again. Then click <b>Person 2</b>. The annotation
has been inserted.</p>
