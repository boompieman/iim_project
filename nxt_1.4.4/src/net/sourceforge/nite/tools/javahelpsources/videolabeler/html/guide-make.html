<h1>Making annotations</h1>

<h2>Selecting agents and layers</h2>

<p>To make new annotations, first make sure that you have selected an agent and
a layer from the <b>Annotate</b> menu, which is shown in Figure 1. You can
select more than one agent or layer. Your screen will show annotation windows
for all combinations of the selected agents and layers. When you don't want to
annotate a certain agent or layer anymore, you can deselect the agent or layer
in the <b>Annotate</b> menu.</p>

<h2>Annotation windows</h2>

<p>Figure 2 shows an example of an annotation window. The title bar shows the
agent (<b>p3</b>) and layer (<b>gaze-layer</b>).</p>

<p>Figure 2: An annotation window</p>

<p>The window consists of three parts. The top part is the annotation area,
which contains the annotations made before. In Figure 2 there are three
annotations. Their targets are <b>Person 2</b>, <b>No target</b> and again
<b>Person 2</b>. The dots give an indication of the duration.</p>

<p>Under the annotation area you can see the start time, end time and target
of the current annotation, if there is one. In this case the window shows an
unfinished annotation. It starts at 25.23 seconds and its target is <b>No
target</b>, but the end of the annotation has not been marked yet. The
<b>Delete</b> button is only enabled when the current annotation is a complete
annotation.</p>

<p>The most important part for making annotations are the target buttons at
the bottom. Normally there is one button for each target in the layer. The gaze
layer however, is a special layer, because the targets are agents. The
Continuous Video Labeling Tool assumes that an agent cannot be the target of
his or her own annotations. In this case agent p3 cannot gaze at himself, so
there is no button named <b>Person 3</b>, although it is one of the possible
targets in the gaze layer.</p>

<p>Figure 3: Target buttons arranged around the video player</p>

<p>The targets of the gaze layer being agents, also means that the buttons are
arranged so that they match the positions of the speakers in the current video
signal, and an extra set of buttons is created and arranged around the video
player, as shown in Figure 3. In this case the current signal is <b>cam1</b>
(selected at the top of the video player). The camera faces persons 3 and 1. At
the other side of the table, but not visible in the video, are persons 2 and 0.
From the positions of the buttons it should be clear where the agents are
seated. At the position of person 3 there is a button named <b>No target</b>.
When you select another signal at the top of the video player, the buttons will
be rearranged.</p>

<p>The extra set of target buttons around the video player, is only shown when
there is exactly one annotation window with agent targets. The target buttons
in the annotation windows have the same arrangement however.</p>

<h2>Adding annotations</h2>

<p>To add an annotation start the video. An annotation covers a certain time
period and you mark the start and end of it. When the video is at the start
point, click the desired target button. You may want to pause the video
first. In the annotation window you can see that you marked the start of a new
annotation, because it shows the target you clicked and the start time. The
end time is still 0, because the end of the annotation has not been marked
yet (see Figure 4).</p>

<p><img src="../images/cvl-markstart.png" width="299" height="81"></p>
<p>Figure 4: The start of an annotation has been marked</p>

<p>Continue playing the video until the end point of your annotation. Because
the annotations have to be continuous, a new annotation should start at this
point. Click the target of this new annotation. The end of the previous
annotation has been marked and you can see that this annotation is added to
the area at the top of the annotation window. The window also shows that you
marked the start of a new annotation. If you wish, you can continue to mark the
end of this annotation and so on.</p>

<p>The Continuous Video Labeling Tool ensures that the annotations for a
certain agent in a certain layer are continuous and they do not overlap each
other. When you add an annotation over existing annotations, the program will
clear the existing annotations in the time period of the new annotation. In
case of complete overlap, this means that the old annotations are deleted. In
case of partial overlap, the start or end time of the old annotation is
changed, so there is room for the new annotation.</p>

<h2>Cancelling a new annotation</h2>

<p>An annotation is only added when you have marked the start of the annotation
first and then you mark the end at a later point in the video. If you marked
the start of an annotation and decide you do not want to add it after all, you
can select an annotation in the area at the top of the annotation window.</p>

<h2>Deleting annotations</h2>

<p>To delete an annotation, you must first select it in the area at the top of
the annotation window. You can select an annotation by clicking it, but make
sure that the annotation window is active. In Figure 5 an annotation has been
selected.</p>

<p><img src="../images/cvl-selection.png" width="300" height="400"></p>
<p>Figure 5: Selected an annotation</p>

<p>The annotation window shows the start and end time and the target of the
selected annotation. The <b>Delete</b> button is enabled. Click it to delete
the selected annotation.</p>

<p>Because the Continuous Video Labeling Tool ensures that the annotations
remain continuous, it tries to fill the gap of the deleted annotation. If there
is an annotation before the deleted element, its end time will be changed so
the gap is filled. If there is only an annotation after the deleted element,
its start time is changed to fill the gap. Now there may be two adjacent
annotations with the same target. In that case the annotations are merged.</p>
