<h1>Playing a video</h1>

<h2>Playback</h2>

<p>With the video player (see Figure 1) you can play any media signal that is
available for the loaded observation. At the top of the player there is a combo
box that lists the available signals (both video and audio). The signals in the
M4 corpora are listed in Table 1.</p>

<p>Table 1: Media signals</p>

<p>At startup, the Continuous Video Labeling Tool loads signal <b>cam1</b>.
When you select another signal, it is loaded into the video player and the
video is paused and reset to the start of the signal.</p>

<p>Under the video is the playback line with a marker that shows the current
time position in the video. You can drag the marker to change the position.
Under the playback line are the control buttons and two check boxes. With the
control buttons you can play and pause the video and you can move the video
position five seconds forward or backward.</p>

<p>The two check boxes are named <b>Synchronise</b> and <b>Mute</b>. When the
<b>Mute</b> box is checked, the audio is not played back.</p>

<h2>Synchronisation</h2>

<p>The <b>Synchronise</b> box is checked at startup and should never be
unchecked, because otherwise the program cannot determine the current video
time. The annotation and view windows are synchronised with the video, so while
you are playing a video, the windows highlight the annotation at the current
video time. Figure 2 shows that the video is at the position of the second gaze
annotation of agent p3.</p>

<p>Figure 2: Annotations are synchronised with the video</p>

<p>You can also select one or more annotations and play the video fragment that
covers the selected annotations. You can select annotations in an
<a href="guide-make.html">annotation window</a> or
<a href="guide-view.html">view window</a>. Just click an annotation or drag
over the annotations that you want to select. Then hold the CTRL key and click
the right mouse button to play back the video fragment.</p>

<h2>Changing the play rate</h2>

<p>At the bottom of the video player you see the rate slider. It is used to
slow down or fasten up the playback. The slider ranges from -4x to +4x and has
an exponential scale. When the slider is positioned at -4x, the video will be
played back 4 times as slow as normal. At +4x the video will be played back
4 times as fast. At position 0 the play rate is normal.</p>

<p>Just drag the marker to change the play rate, but note that the rate is only
changed when the player is paused. If the video player is playing, you can
still drag the marker and the play rate will change as soon as you pause the
player.</p>

<p>When the rate slider is not at position 0, the <b>Reset</b> button is
enabled. Click it to reset the slider to position 0.</p>
