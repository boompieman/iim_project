<h1>Viewing annotations</h1>

<p>When you <a href="guide-make.html">make annotations</a> for a certain agent
and layer, you can see the annotations for that agent and layer in the
annotation window. However, you can also view annotations without selecting an
agent and layer for annotation. In that case select a layer from the
<b>View</b> menu (see Figure 1). Your screen will show view windows for the
selected layers. To close a view window, deselect the layer in the <b>View</b>
menu.</p>

<p>Figure 2 shows a view window. The title bar shows the name of the layer.
There are tab sheets for the available agents. In Figure 2 you see the
gaze annotations for agent p3.</p>

<p>The view window shows the targets of the annotations, in this case <b>Person
2</b>, <b>No target</b> and again <b>Person 2</b>. The dots indicate the
duration of an annotation.</p>
