<h1>Media Player</h1>

<p>The Media Player (Figure 1) can
display audio and video signals. </p>

<p>At the top of the Media Player is
the combo box listing all available signals for the chosen observation. When you choose a new signal from the list,
the signal is loaded and the player is paused and reset to the start of the
signal.</p>

<p>Located at the bottom of the
Media Player are the control buttons, the synchronize check box, the mute check
box and the playback line. The control buttons are the play/pause button, and
the 5 seconds forward and backward buttons. If the synchronize check box is selected the system is in synchronized
mode. In the synchronized mode, the highlighted transcription segment or
annotation element in the Transcription Area is at the current video and/or
audio time.</p>

<p>The mute check box is used to enable/disable the audio file.</p>

<p>The horizontal playback line controls the playback of the
signal files.</p>

<p>You can play the video and/or
audio fragment for a transcription fragment holding the CTRL key while selecting the fragment of text that you want to replay.</p>
