<h1>Adjacency Pairs annotation</h1>

<p>This section contains
instructions how to create, delete and change AP annotations using the DA
Annotation tool.</p>

<h2>AP Creation</h2>

<p>Press the "A" key or the New
button in the Adjacency Pairs Editor. The system is now in the "AP creation"
mode. The message to select the "source" dialogue act will appear in the Status
and Feedback Window. Select the "source" dialogue act by <a href="guide-da.html">clicking on a dialogue
act</a> in the Transcription Area. The message to select the
target dialogue act will appear in the Status and Feedback Window. Select a
dialogue act in the Transcription Area. The created AP element is displayed in
the Adjacency Pairs Area. The "source" dialogue act is yellow highlighted in
the Transcription Area; the "target" dialogue act is orange highlighted in the
Transcription Area; the created AP is green highlighted in the Adjacency Pairs
Area.</p>

<p>To select the type of the AP,
click on the Type button and select an AP type from the list. If no type is
selected the default value for the AP types will be displayed.</p>

<h2>Manipulating AP Annotations</h2>

<p>Select the AP element that you
want to change by clicking with the left mouse button on the element in the
Adjacency Pairs Area. The currently
selected AP element is displayed in the Adjacency Pairs Editor.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><b>Changing the selected AP element</b></p>

<p>The selected
AP element can be changed in three ways: changing the type, changing the
"source" dialogue act, and changing the "target" dialogue act</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><b>Changing the type of AP</b></p>

<p>Press the Type
button in the Adjacency Pairs Editor and select a new type of the AP from the
list</p></li>

<li><p><b>Changing the "source" of the AP</b></p>

<p>Press the 'S'
key or the Source button. Select a new dialogue act in the Transcription Area
as the source of the AP</p></li>

<li><p><b>Changing the "target" of the AP</b></p>

<p>Press the 'T' key or the Target button. Select
a new dialogue act in the Transcription Area as the target of the AP</p></li>
</ul>

<li><p><b>Deleting the selected AP element</b></p>

<p>To delete the
selected AP element, press the Delete button in the Adjacency Pairs Area. You
will not be asked to confirm the deletion of the element.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Cancel action</h2>

<p>You might want to cancel the
creation of the new AP element or changes of the source and/or the target
element of the AP. To cancel those actions, press the "Escape" key. The message
about the cancellation of the initialized actions will appear in the Status and
Feedback Window.</p>

<h2>Exporting adjacency pairs</h2>

<p>To export all adjacency pairs to a text file, choose <b>File->Export
adjacency pairs</b> and select a file. The file will contain all adjacency
pairs sorted on the start times of their source dialogue acts. Each line in the
file contains the ID and type of the adjacency pair and the ID, type and text
of the source and target dialogue acts. The fields are separated by tabs, so
you can open the file for instance in a spreadsheet.</p>
