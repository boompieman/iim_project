<h1>Dialogue Act Annotation</h1>

<p>This section contains instructions
how to create, delete and change dialogue act annotations using the DA
Annotation tool.</p>

<h2>Dialogue Act Creation</h2>

<p>The first step in creating a
dialogue act annotation is a selection of the text segment in the Transcription
Area which corresponds to the dialogue act.</p>

<p>You select a text fragment in the
Transcription Area by clicking with the left mouse button at the start position
and dragging to the end position. If you
click in the middle of a word, the selection will be expanded to include the
whole word.</p>

<p>The selection may contain only
speech fragments of a single speaker. Speech fragments of the other speakers will
be omitted from the selection. Red
highlighting is used to mark the current text selection in the Transcription
Area.</p>

<p>The selection cannot contain the
text segments of the other already annotated dialogue acts.</p>

<p>After the selection is made,
press the 'D' key or press the New DA button in the Dialogue Act Editor in
order to create a new dialogue act element for the selected speech fragment.
The dialogue act popup list will appear in the Transcription Area (Figure 1).
Select a dialogue act type from the dialogue act popup list. The selected DA
type and the speech fragment will be displayed in the Dialogue Act Editor as
well as in the Transcription Area. If
the dialogue act type is not selected the current selection in the
Transcription Area will be enclosed in brackets and marked with "Dialogue-act"
string. This means that the dialogue act boundaries are determined and the
dialogue act is created but the type of the dialogue act is not determined. The
selection of the DA type can be done additionally by pressing the button Type
in the Dialogue Act Editor and selecting the dialogue act type from the list.</p>

<h2>Addressee annotation</h2>

<p>For each person that belongs to
the addressee group, select the corresponding checkbox. If the addressees of
the dialogue act are all meeting participants, press the ALL button to select
all checkboxes. The checkbox, which corresponds to the speaker of the dialogue
act, is automatically disabled. This prevents that the speaker of the dialogue
act is at the same time the addressee of the dialogue act.</p>

<h2>Manipulating DA annotation</h2>

<p>Select the dialogue act that you
want to change by clicking with the left mouse button on the dialogue act
representation in the Transcription Area (e.g. the dialogue act type or
brackets which enclose the range of the dialogue act)</p>

<p>The currently selected dialogue
act is represented in the Dialogue Act Editor.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><b>Changing the selected dialogue act element</b></p>

<p>The selected DA element can be changed in
three ways: changing the type, changing the range and changing the value of the
addressee attribute.</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><b>Changing the type</b></p>

<p>Press the Type button in the Dialogue Act Editor. Choose a new dialogue act type from the list.</p></li>

<li><p><b>Changing the range</b></p>

<p>Press the 'R'
key or the Range button in the Dialogue Act Editor. Select a new text range in the Transcription Area.</p></li>

<li><p><b>Changing the
value of the addressee attribute</b></p>

<p>Select the
checkboxes that correspond to the addressees of the dialogue act. Use the
All/None button to select/deselect all checkboxes.</p></li>
</ul>

<li><p><b>Deleting the selected dialogue act element</b></p>

<p>To delete the DA element from the corpus, press the Delete button in the
Dialogue Act Editor or press the "Delete" key or press "Shift+Delete".</p>

<p>Pressing the "Delete" key you will be asked to confirm the deletion of the
DA.</p>

<p>Pressing the Delete button in the Dialogue Act Editor the DA element will be
deleted without asking for confirmation. The same effect will be achieved by
pressing the "Shift +Delete".</p>

<p>If there are adjacency pairs whose source or target is the deleted dialogue
act, these adjacency pairs are deleted as well.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Exporting dialogue acts</h2>

<p>To export all dialogue acts to a text file, choose <b>File->Export dialogue
acts</b> and select a file. The file will contain all dialogue acts sorted on
their start times. Each line in the file contains the ID, type, agent,
addressees and text of the dialogue act. The fields are separated by tabs, so
you can open the file for instance in a spreadsheet.</p>
