<h1>Starting annotations</h1>

<p>Before you actually start annotating,
you should choose a signal file from the list of the available signals at the
top of the Media Player. We suggest that you select the mixed video file that
contains merged video files synchronized with the audio file. Playing
this file, you have a complete overview of the meeting (e.g. locations of the
participants, who is the current speaker, where is the speaker looking, etc.).
All these types of information are needed to determine the addressee of a
dialogue act. If you want to annotate only dialogue acts without annotating the
addressees or to annotate adjacency pairs the audio file is sufficient.</p>

<p>We also recommend that you always <a href="ref-media.html">select the Synchronize checkbox</a>.</p>
