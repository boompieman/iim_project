<h2>calc package</h2>
This package contains the interfaces and classes necessary for calculating: kappa, alpha, distance metric interface, confusion matrices, etc.
See datainspection package docs for more info.
A package of worker classes for calculation of alpha and kappa measures.
Basis is units or Items that are assigned Values between which a certain DistanceMetric 
holds which is used to calculate Kappa or Alpha from a CoincidenceMatrix.

Made by Rieks op den Akker.

To be added to this documentation:

* use example (but see main method of CoincidenceMatrix)
* references to krippendorff, cohen, siegel and castellan writings on basis of which this was implemented
* references to Rieks's writings for which package was made
* reference to kappa squib mentioning that values in themselves are not enough to provide a reliability analysis.
