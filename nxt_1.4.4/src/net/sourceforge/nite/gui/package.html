This package provides user interface elements which can be used by programmers developing new NXT based tools as well as, in some cases, by people who use the stylesheet engine to create new displays and other GUIs.
<p>
There are three viewer packages: {@link net.sourceforge.nite.gui.mediaviewer mediaviewer} contains the classes needed to add audio and video players to your applications; {@link net.sourceforge.nite.gui.textviewer textviewer} contains support for a textarea that can display text representations of NOMElements, including support for time alignment highlighting and query result highlighting; {@link net.sourceforge.nite.gui.transcriptionviewer transcriptionviewer} specializes on the textviewer classes, targeting the display of <i>speech transcriptions</i> and transcription related annotations.
<p>
The {@link net.sourceforge.nite.gui.actions actions} package is focused mostly on the stylesheet engine and contains a lot of useful widgets and actions that can be included in stylesheet-based NXT interaces.
<p>
The {@link net.sourceforge.nite.gui.util util} package finally contains a mixture of useful objects, actions, popups, dialogs and widgets mostly used in CallableTool implementations.
<p>
Of special interest is the {@link net.sourceforge.nite.gui.util.AbstractCallableTool AbstractCallableTool} class, which allows a developer to quickly and easily develop a wide range of annotation tools with a lot of useful functionalities such as in-built search windows, specialized views of transcription data, etc.
